Simplyblock storage can be attached over the network to Linux hosts which are not running Kubernetes,
Proxmox or OpenStack.

While no simplyblock components must be installed on these hosts, some OS-level configuration steps are required.
Those manual steps are typically taken care of by the CSI driver or Proxmox integration.

On plain Linux initiators, those steps have to be performed manually on each host that will connect simplyblock logical
volumes.

### Install Nvme Client Package

    === "RHEL / Alma / Rocky"
    
        ```bash
        sudo dnf install -y nvme-cli
        ```
    
    === "Debian / Ubuntu"
    
        ```bash
        sudo apt install -y nvme-cli
        ```

### Load the NVMe over Fabrics Kernel Modules 

For NVMf/tcp and NVMf/rdma:
{% include 'prepare-nvme-tcp.md' %}

### Create a Storage Pool

Before logical volumes can be created and connected, a storage pool is required. If a pool already exists, it can be
reused. Otherwise, creating a storage pool can be created on any control plane node as follows:

```bash title="Create a Storage Pool"
{{ cliname }} pool add <POOL_NAME> <CLUSTER_UUID>
```

The last line of a successful storage pool creation returns the new pool id.

```plain title="Example output of creating a storage pool"
[demo@demo ~]# {{ cliname }} pool add test 4502977c-ae2d-4046-a8c5-ccc7fa78eb9a
2025-03-05 06:36:06,093: INFO: Adding pool

```

### Create and Connect a Logical Volume

To create a new logical volume, the following command can be run on any control plane node.

```bash
{{ cliname }} volume add \
  --max-rw-iops <IOPS> \
  --max-r-mbytes <THROUGHPUT> \
  --max-w-mbytes <THROUGHPUT> \
  --ndcs <DATA CHUNKS IN STRIPE> \
  --npcs <PARITY CHUNKS IN STRIPE>
  --fabric {tcp, rdma}
  --lvol-priority-class <1-6>
  <VOLUME_NAME> \
  <VOLUME_SIZE> \
  <POOL_NAME>

```
!!! info
    ```ndcs``` and ```npcs``` define the erasure coding schema (e.g. ```--ndcs=4 --npcs=2```). The settings are optional, if
    not specified the cluster default is chosen. Valid for ```ndcs``` are 1,2 and 4 and for ```npcs``` 0,1 and 2, but
    consider that the number of cluster nodes must be equal to or larger than (```ndcs``` + ```npcs```)
    ```--fabric``` defines the fabric by which the volume is connected to the cluster. It is optional, default is ```tcp```. ```rdma``` can only be chosen for hosts
    with rdma-capable NIC and if the cluster supports rdma. A priority class is optional too and can be chosen only, if the cluster defines it. A cluster can define
    0-6 priority classes (0 is the default). 

```plain title="Example of creating a logical volume"
{{ cliname }} volume add --ndcs 2 --ndcs 1 --fabric tcp lvol01 1000G test  
```

In this example, a logical volume with the name `lvol01` and 1TB of thinly provisioned capacity is created in the pool
named `test`. The uuid of the logical volume is returned at the end of the operation.

For additional parameters, see [Add a new Logical Volume](../../reference/cli/volume.md#adds-a-new-logical-volume).

To connect a logical volume on the initiator (or Linux client), execute the following command on a any control plane
node. This command returns one or more connection commands to be executed on the client.

```bash
{{ cliname }} volume connect \
  <VOLUME_ID>
```

```plain title="Example of retrieving the connection strings of a logical volume"
{{ cliname }} volume connect a898b44d-d7ee-41bb-bc0a-989ad4711780

sudo nvme connect --reconnect-delay=2 --ctrl-loss-tmo=3600 --nr-io-queues=32 --keep-alive-tmo=5 --transport=tcp --traddr=10.10.20.2 --trsvcid=9101 --nqn=nqn.2023-02.io.simplyblock:fa66b0a0-477f-46be-8db5-b1e3a32d771a:lvol:a898b44d-d7ee-41bb-bc0a-989ad4711780
sudo nvme connect --reconnect-delay=2 --ctrl-loss-tmo=3600 --nr-io-queues=32 --keep-alive-tmo=5 --transport=tcp --traddr=10.10.20.3 --trsvcid=9101 --nqn=nqn.2023-02.io.simplyblock:fa66b0a0-477f-46be-8db5-b1e3a32d771a:lvol:a898b44d-d7ee-41bb-bc0a-989ad4711780
```

The output can be copy-pasted to the host to which the volumes should be attached.
