Simplyblock supports in-place upgrades of existing clusters. However, not all versions can be upgraded straight to
the latest versions. Hence, some upgrades may include multiple steps.

Possible upgrade paths are described in the following table. If the currently installed version is not listed on the
requested version, an upgrade to a further supported version must be executed first.

| Requested Version | Installed Version | 
|-------------------|-------------------|
| 25.5.x            | 25.5.x, 25.3-PRE  |
| 25.7.7            | 25.7.5.           | 
| 25.10.1           | 25.7.5., 25.7.7.  |
| 25.10.4.2         | 25.10.5           |
